 * This module provides an API for threads handling with a common interface for all operating
 * systems.
 * This API provides minimal handling for threads, including the following:
 * 1. Thread IDs
 * 2. Thread Local Storage
 *
 * The Windows version contains the DLLMain routine , This routine is called whenever a new process
 * or a new thread is attached to the core dll.
 *
 * The thread module allocates Thread local storage per each thread that uses the core. In the thread
 * local storage we keep information that is kept per thread for the LI ( networking and timer modules(.
